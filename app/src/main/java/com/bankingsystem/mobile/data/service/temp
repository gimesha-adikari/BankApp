Demo scope
Which checks must be in the demo flow: Face match, Liveness, OCR, Doc class — all four?
for now yes but can be added more checks and functions later

Single-country focus (Sri Lankan NIC) or multi-country placeholders?
for now yes but maybe improve later

Runtime & dependencies
OK to use PyTorch/ONNX + CUDA if available, or must be CPU-only?
yes can, i think it can be run on rtx3060

Are OpenCV and Tesseract acceptable? Internet access allowed at runtime (e.g., to download models) or must be fully offline?
what are those?

Data & privacy
Do you have any sample images (even anonymized) or should I stick to synthetic fixtures?
i have no images yet

Should images be discarded after scoring (no disk writes) for the demo?
the photos only need to be stored until approval or rejection and Spring boot backend would save them until that so no need to save in ML system i think

Performance envelope
Target inference latency per request and memory budget?
i have no idea about that yet

Max request size (image resolution/base64 payload limits)?
currently max is 20 * 1024 * 1024 for per aggregation req

“Success” criteria
What FAR/FRR tradeoff should we aim to show (e.g., <=1% FAR at ~90% pass on GOOD)?
at a reasonable level

Any must-have explainable in responses (e.g., portrait bbox, OCR fields, top doc class, decision reasons already present)?
did not think yet
